# Transaction Code Generator Part

function generateTransactionCode(type) {
This line declares a function called generateTransactionCode that takes one parameter, type.

const letters = "ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ";
This line declares a constant variable called letters that contains a string of capital letters (excluding I, O, and T).

typescript
Copy code
let code = `MBK${type}`;
This line initializes a variable called code with a string that starts with "MBK" and adds the type parameter to the end.

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
This line starts a for loop that will run four times.

Copy code
if (i < 3) {
  let num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1;
  code += num;
}
This code block is inside the for loop and will only run for the first three iterations. It generates a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and appends it to the code variable.

let letter = letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * letters.length)];
code += letter;
This code block is also inside the for loop and will run for all four iterations. It generates a random letter from the letters string and appends it to the code variable.

}
This line ends the for loop.


return code;
This line returns the final code variable, which is the transaction code generated by the function.
